This is one of my first projects with a graphical interface.

The standard power button - F6 (DO NOT CONFUSE, I HAVE SPECIFIED EVERYTHING)

For all questions, I have a discord - imhartash

The current version is v0.31

the .exe file is located in the realeses folder. Debug folder - for checking and detecting errors, it will simply open with a console for logs. You can use it

Some information:

The project was made with a couple of libraries, such as - PySide6, Pynput, Mouse, Keyboard.

As an envelope in .exe I used auto-py-to-exe which uses pyinstaller.

All sources are in the repository with the project. File main.py - the main file or executable. In the file resourses.py there are all icons that have been used. If there is __ in the file, it means it is closed or there is something useless there for now. ui_main.py - GUI file. 

!! If you think that this file is unsafe, then all the sources are in the repository, I just converted it to .exe !!
